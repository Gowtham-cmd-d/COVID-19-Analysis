# 🦠 COVID-19 Analysis & Visualization using Plotly Express
## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes and visualizes the global impact of COVID-19 using Python, Pandas, and Plotly Express. The goal is to uncover insights into confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and testing across countries, as well as trends over time.

By leveraging interactive visualizations, we make the data more accessible and easier to interpret for decision-makers, researchers, and the general public.

# 📂 Datasets Used

The project integrates three datasets for a comprehensive analysis:

covid.csv → Country-level summary (cases, deaths, recoveries, testing, population, WHO regions).

covid_grouped.csv → Daily time-series data of confirmed, deaths, recovered, active cases per country.

coviddeath.csv → US-specific data of COVID-19 deaths by age group and medical conditions.

# 🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess COVID-19 datasets.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Create interactive visualizations with Plotly Express:

Line charts for time-series trends.

Bar charts for country comparisons.

Bubble/scatter plots for relationship analysis.

Choropleth maps for geographical spread.

Analyze US death data by age and comorbidities.

Summarize key insights and findings.

# 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas, NumPy → Data wrangling

Plotly Express → Interactive visualizations

Matplotlib & Seaborn → Supporting static charts

Jupyter/Colab → Development environment

# 📊 Key Insights (Sample)

Countries like USA, India, and Brazil reported the highest number of confirmed cases.

Choropleth maps highlight global spread across continents.

Deaths are disproportionately higher in elderly age groups and those with respiratory/heart-related conditions.

Interactive plots make it possible to filter by country/region and observe trends dynamically.
